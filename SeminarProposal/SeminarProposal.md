    Summary:
	We're convinced that doing this topic is meaningful due to the ever increasing need for buisness to provide constant suppport
    for their customers. Industires such as education, medicine, and mobile (personal assistants) are all implementing converstaional interfaces/bots
    in order to fulfill specific buisness needs. As converstaional bots become more prevalenat in different industries new software architectures
    will be developed based on buisness needs therefore there is an increasing need to study different software architectures specific to converational bots 
    in order to effictively implement these solutions in the real world. Additionally as buisness are removing the need for GUI's via converstaional interfaces/bots
    a whole host of human-computer interaction challenges. 

    Pros:
    The pros of choosing converstional interfaces/bots for a seminar topic are that ceratin applications of converstaional interfaces/bots are highly developed
    and the industry has a mature understanding of how these techologies should be used in these contexts. Additonally conversational bots are an attractive field
    of study so theres on going research being published about this topic thats easily accessble from acm, google scholar, etc.

    Cons:
    There are specific applicaiton of converational interface/bots that are emerging that may have less conclusve evidence for ceratain claims. Topics like this would
    likely stem from applications such as conversational bots application in fields such as psychology and medicine. The field of conversational bots can get highly technical
    quickly as the softare archietecture revolves highly around the specific algorithms that are being utilized to perform tasks such as NLP, CI, etc. For an overview of 
    conversational interfaces/bots looking at these technologies from a high level will likely be necessary.
